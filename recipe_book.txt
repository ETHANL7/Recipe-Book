Introduction 


Finally, after years of pushing the idea, world-class chefs Ethan Lethridge and I, Kieran Duncan decided that it was finally time to 
team up and give the idea of a recipe book company a try.Maybe share some of the things we learned from the kitchen during our studies.
As our first book publication, we would like to thank and dedicate this book to the people who believed 
in us from the beginning during the long and difficult process, the family members and friends who supported us along the way.We cannot 
forget to mention our mentors. If it wasn't for them we wouldn't be where we are today.
However, this journey is what brought us to becoming world-class chefs and it is what inspired us to team up and become co-founders of a recipe book company.
The reason why we decided to create a recipe book company is because we wanted to share our experience gained through many years of culinary studies which 
took us all around the globe, to give the people at home a different taste of a home cooked meal. 
This was also done because we want to give the people at home a new type of
connection to a culture of food which were unfamiliar to the region.
Our experiences took us far and wide, from Italy to mastering pasta making, France to learn the art of bread and cheese making, all 
the way to japan to learn the fine art of sushi making.
Our first book contains just a few of the many recipes which for a reason or another we found to be interesting or which we found to be different.

We hope your enjoy!
